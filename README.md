This Github action is an official [Relisio](https://www.relisio.com/) deploy utility.<br />
Use it to create products within your workspace.

### Prerequisites
 1. an active workspace at [www.relisio.com](https://www.relisio.com) or a self-hosted copy of Relisio;
 2. an `api-key` authorized to **Create Product** (in Relisio, go to workspace settings, Api Keys to generate one);
 3. a GitHub repository configured to run Actions;

### Before you start

 1. consider that Relisio is currently in Beta, and breaking changes may occur at any time,
 2. the `api-key` can be generated (and destroyed) from your workspace settings,
 3. optionally you may use this action together with 
    - `Studio-41/relisio-artefact-action@v1`
    - `Studio-41/relisio-project-action@v1`

## Deploy a new product

The following example publishes a new product into your workspace every time a Tag (having `v` prefix) is created.<br/>

 - An empty product will be created as the `product-template-id` isn't specified.
 - The product will be created inside the Workspace `workspace-path`.
 - As the `visibility` is `internal`, the product will be visible by the users at the workspace only.

```yaml
on:
  push:
    tags:
      - "v*"

jobs:
  deloy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
    - name: Deploy As Relisio Product 
      uses: Studio-41/relisio-product-action@v1
      with:
        api-key: ${{ secrets.RELISIO_API_KEY }}
        workspace-path: ${{ secrets.RELISIO_WORKSPACE }}
        product-scope: internal
        product-name: The Name of The Product
```

## Deploy a new product (cloning a template)

The following example publishes a new product, cloning an existing one, into your workspace.<br/>

 - A new product will be created cloning the product `product-template-id`.
 - The product will be created inside the Workspace `workspace-path`.
 - As the `visibility` is `public`, the product will be visible by the Internet (if you are running a self-hosted version of Relisio, `public` is may be limited by your networking policies).

```yaml
on:
  push:
    tags:
      - "v*"

jobs:
  deloy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
    - name: Deploy As Relisio Product 
      uses: Studio-41/relisio-product-action@v1
      with:
        api-key: ${{ secrets.RELISIO_API_KEY }}
        workspace-path: ${{ secrets.RELISIO_WORKSPACE }}
        product-scope: public
        product-template-id: ${{ secrets.RELISIO_PRODUCT_TEMPLATE_ID }}
```
